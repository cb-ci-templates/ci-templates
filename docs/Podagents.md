# Why to use specific containers rather than injecting tools during runtime of a Pod

Injecting required tools into a generic vanilla Docker container at runtime rather than using containers with pre-baked tools has a few downsides:

## Dependency Management Complexity 
Managing dependencies at runtime can be more complex compared to having them pre-installed in a container image. This approach requires additional scripts or mechanisms to download and install dependencies dynamically, which may introduce potential errors or inconsistencies.

## Increased Container Startup Time
Docker containers with pre-installed tools have shorter startup times since they don't need to download and install dependencies during runtime. Injecting tools at runtime can significantly increase the time it takes to start up a container, especially if the required tools are large or numerous.

## Security Risks 

Dynamically downloading and installing tools at runtime can introduce security risks. For example, if the source from which the tools are downloaded is compromised, it could result in the installation of malicious software onto the container. Pre-baking tools into the container image allows for a more controlled and secure environment, as the tools are vetted and verified before the image is built.

## Lack of Reproducibility

Injecting tools at runtime may lead to inconsistencies across different container instances or environments. Since the tools are not included in the container image itself, there's a risk that different instances of the same container may end up with different versions of the tools or even different tools altogether, depending on factors such as network connectivity or availability of external repositories.

## Increased Image Size 

If the required tools are not already present in the base image, injecting them at runtime will increase the overall size of the container. This can lead to larger image sizes, longer deployment times, and increased resource consumption.

In contrast, using Docker containers with pre-baked tools offers benefits such as faster startup times, improved security, better reproducibility, and smaller image sizes. However, it requires additional effort in maintaining and updating the container images to ensure that the included tools are up-to-date and secure.
